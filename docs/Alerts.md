# Alert

The alert component is useful for displaying messages intended to get the attention of your end users. BladewindUI alerts are in two variants. Dark alerts and faint alerts. Dark here is not to be confused with dark mode. This just provides a darker shade of the colour used, depending on what type of alert is displayed.

Breezemin alerts are displayed inline by default. You may want to check out the Notification component if you want something more intrusive. For each colour shade there are four alert types, info error warning and success.
