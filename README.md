# Breezemin

Laravel Breeze is a lightweight starter kit that provides a simple, minimalistic authentication system for Laravel applications. It is designed to help developers quickly scaffold the basic authentication system and get started with building their applications.

Breeze includes built-in support for basic features such as registration, login, email verification, password reset, and two-factor authentication. It uses Laravel's built-in authentication system, which provides secure and customizable authentication functionality.

However, Laravel Breeze does not include an admin panel out of the box. It is primarily focused on providing a basic authentication system, and developers will need to build the admin panel themselves or use a separate package or library to add one to their application.

There are several popular admin panel packages available for Laravel, including Voyager, Nova, and Backpack. These packages provide a range of features and functionality for building robust and customizable admin panels that can help streamline application development and management.
